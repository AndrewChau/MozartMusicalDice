# Mozart Musical Dice

In 1787 the famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart devised a Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel (musical dice game) that lets you "compose without the least knowledge of music". Obviously, this is a very loose definition of "compose", but it does produce pieces of music that have probably never been written down or played before. We'll be playing his game today (with some simplifications so you don't need to know musical notation).
